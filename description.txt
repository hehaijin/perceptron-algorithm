The code is in Python 3.6.

For multiclass classification, for each class label,I train a binary classfication of this label and all other class labels combined. The classification result is the classification function that gives the biggest result.

For original data, 10 fold cross-validataion linear classification takes 31 seconds, and the average accuracy is 0.9777

For Harr reduced data, the time goes down as fewer dimensions are kepted, and the accuracy is algo going down.

When reduced to only 2 dimensions, it takes 15 seconds, and the average accuracy is 0.46.
